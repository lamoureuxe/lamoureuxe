Hello, my name is Erik Lamoureux (@lamoureuxe) and I'm a PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Mechanical Engineering. I conduct research at the intersection of mechatronics and biomedical engineering, where I use deep learning and computer vision to identify and assess single cells. I am working on projects evaluating the quality of red blood cells and sperm cells. 

Some of my recent work includes genome informatics (using R and Unix) and computer vision and deep learning (image segmentation, classification, regression) using Tensorflow-Keras and PyTorch.

My current projects include:
- Using deep learning (CNNs and transformers) in PyTorch (with automatic hyperparameter optimization) to evaluate red blood cell morphology for assessing its connection to transfusion longevity. 
- Implementing distributed computing for real-time imaging and inference of microscopy images to identify rare sperm cells in disaggregated testis biopsies.
