Hello, my name is Erik Lamoureux (@lamoureuxe) and I'm a PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Mechanical Engineering. I conduct research at the intersection of mechatronics and biomedical engineering. My research involves using deep learning and computer vision to identify and assess single cells, specifically the quality of red blood cells and sperm cells. 

Iâ€™m currently learning techniques to conduct genome informatics (using R and Unix) and computer vision and deep learning (image segmentation, classification, regression) using Tensorflow-Keras and PyTorch.

My current projects include:
- Using deep learning (CNNs and transformers) in PyTorch optimized with Weights and Biases (wandb) to evaluate red blood cell morphology for assessing its connection to transfusion longevity. 
- Implementing distributed computing for real-time imaging and inference of microscopy images to identify rare sperm cells in disaggregated testis biopsies.
